## Face Morph in Python
In order to use this code, you will need to download an "landmarks" file for the facial recognition here: https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat

Place that file in the same folder as the python file before running the program.
